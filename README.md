# Amazon Review Web Scraper and Analysis

Every time I am serious about buying a quality product I look up reviews online so I can see what people have to say about the product. Ultimately I am interested in what bad things people have to say about it. What problems are the experiencing and do I think I will have the same problem.  
  
This project takes checking reviews for issues to a whole new level.  
  
I built a web scraper for retrieving all of the reviews for a particular product. I then stored the data in a CSV file for analyzing later. 
For the analysis, I chose to scrape all of the reviews for the Amazon Fire Stick because it has more reviews than any other product on Amazon.  I cleaned up my data and did some ground level text analysis. This resulted in finding that one of the most common problems is with the remote. Upon further analysis, it seems to be that it is more specifically with the batteries of the remote.  
  
In the long run, less than 3% of the reviews actually mentioned having issues with the remote.
